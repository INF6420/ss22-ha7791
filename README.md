# Demetrius Horton Project

## Description

# An art gallery of my character and creature designs and landscape sketches. It will contain a landing page, a bio, a three-page art gallery showcasing my creature, character, and landscape artwork and a contact page.

## Wireframes

# I have included several wireframes that showcase the layout and structure of each page on my site as the links in the navbar are highlighted. I forgot to include a header, so the final version will include that.
